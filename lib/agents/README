MCollective Agents
To be installed on targets (generally in /usr/libexec/mcollective/mcollective/agents)

The latest for any custom agents located here will generally be on my github
(I need to put a webpage together for this)

I'm not bundling the puppetd agent as it's not mine.  I should ask R.I. Plienar if he minds if I do at a
later date.
